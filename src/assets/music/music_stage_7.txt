Ambient fantasy sci-fi soundtrack for exploring a breathtaking alien world made of glowing crystals and fragile glass structures. Delicate chimes, resonant crystal tones, shimmering synths, and airy pads evoke wonder and fragility. Use high-frequency textures and light reverb to simulate reflective surfaces and ambient echoes. Slow to moderate tempo (60–80 BPM). Inspired by Ori and the Blind Forest, No Man’s Sky crystalline biomes, and Final Fantasy crystal realms. Emphasize mystery, serenity, and beauty with a touch of otherworldly magic.
