High-energy combat music with a strong military-style snare and tom drum rhythm driving the action forward. Combine retro arcade battle music elements (like chiptune synths, arpeggios, and sharp melodic hooks) with modern hybrid orchestration. Include brass stabs, rhythmic basslines, and fast-paced tempo (around 120â€“140 BPM) to create urgency. Layer dynamic drumlines with digital synth leads to evoke a nostalgic yet powerful battlefield vibe. Inspired by classic arcade and JRPG battle themes like Streets of Rage, Final Fantasy, and Metal Slug, with a cinematic flair.
