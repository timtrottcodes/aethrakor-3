Defeat music with a melancholic, minor-key melody. Slow tempo with ambient pads, soft piano, distant strings, and subtle retro synths to evoke sadness and introspection. Include sparse percussion and low brass to add emotional weight. Inspired by game over themes from classic JRPGs and arcade games, creating a reflective, slightly haunting atmosphere that signals loss without harshness.
