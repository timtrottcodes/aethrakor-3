Dark, atmospheric soundtrack for a desolate and corrupted world known as The Blighted Reach. The sky bleeds violet light, the ground fractures underfoot, and twisted remnants of life whisper in the wind. Use unsettling drones, distorted ambient textures, slow and eerie synth melodies, distant mechanical groans, and fractured rhythms. Incorporate minor keys, heavy reverb, and low-frequency pulses to evoke dread and decay. Inspired by soundtracks from Dark Souls, Hyper Light Drifter, and Annihilation. Tempo should be slow (40â€“60 BPM), evoking a sense of creeping dread and broken beauty.
