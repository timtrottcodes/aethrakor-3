Gentle fantasy adventure music set in a peaceful countryside. Soft acoustic guitar, light flutes, and warm strings. Relaxed tempo (80â€“90 BPM), evoking a sense of curiosity and lighthearted exploration. Birds chirping, ambient breeze effects optional. Inspired by early RPG starting zones like those in Zelda or Stardew Valley. Ideal for early game pacing.
