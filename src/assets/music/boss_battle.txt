High-energy boss battle music with a driving military-style snare and tom drumbeat, inspired by classic arcade and retro battle soundtracks. Intense orchestral stabs, fast-paced synth arpeggios, and electric guitar riffs add urgency and suspense. Includes dramatic crescendos and punchy bass hits to emphasize danger and action. Tempo should be fast and relentless, with dynamic shifts to heighten tension. Perfect for a climactic final showdown in a fantasy or sci-fi video game.
