Dark, ambient fantasy soundtrack for exploring a deep underground cave. Slow, echoing tones with low drones, subtle percussive taps (like dripping water), and soft, dissonant strings or synths. Mysterious and claustrophobic atmosphere with a hint of ancient danger. Tempo: 60–70 BPM. Inspired by deep dungeon themes from games like Dark Souls, Hollow Knight, and Skyrim’s Dwemer ruins. Emphasize isolation, tension, and slow exploration.
