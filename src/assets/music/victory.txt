Triumphant fantasy victory music with uplifting orchestral swells, joyful brass fanfare, and shimmering chiptune arpeggios. Blend celebratory melodies with harp glissandos, bells, and a steady major-key rhythm. Include light percussion (snare rolls and cymbal crashes) and warm synth pads to evoke a sense of reward and heroic accomplishment. Inspired by classic RPG victory themes from Final Fantasy and Chrono Trigger, with a touch of retro arcade flair.
