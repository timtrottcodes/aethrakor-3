Mystical ambient soundtrack for exploring forgotten ruins. Ethereal pads, plucked instruments like dulcimer or harp, and soft percussive echoes. Music should feel ancient and awe-inspiring, with hints of danger and mystery. Moderate tempo (70â€“85 BPM), loopable, with subtle melodic shifts. Inspired by the ruins in Tomb Raider and Breath of the Wild.
